## Problem Statement
1. Patients can “call” platform - serviced by one of available doctors
 2. Call and conversation can be supported by either chat or audio/video (WebRTC)
 channel. Should simulate incoming/outgoing calls, as well as waiting/busy conditions
 3. Online consultation, recording of clinical details, issue of prescription
 ○ Patient can upload clinical records (history)
 ○ Mechanism for doctor to see prior history and add details, and register follow-ups
 ○ Mechanism for doctors to view callers and follow-ups
 ○ Prescriptions only for video calls or where identity of caller can be verified
 4. Handling repeat callers
 5. Consent for sharing record with other hospitals
 6. Ability for senior doctor to monitor activities across channels
 7. *Audio calls can also be done from regular phones (non-WebRTC - no app needed).
 No appointments needed for this
 8. *Chatbot as a possible initial interaction for chats. Can help patients navigate the app.

## Objective:
1. Develop and implement a comprehensive Tele-Consulting Platform to facilitate remote
 medical consultations with multiple doctors.

 and chat channels.
3. Ensure secure and efficient online consultations, including clinical record management,
 prescription issuance, and follow-up scheduling.
4.  Implement mechanisms to facilitate seamless continuity of care.
5. Establish a consent mechanism for patients to authorize the sharing of their medical
 records with other healthcare facilities.
6. Enable real-time monitoring of platform activities by senior doctors to ensure quality
 control and compliance.
7. Integrate a chatbot to improve user experience and guide patients through the platform.
